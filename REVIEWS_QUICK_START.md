## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Reviews Not Loading
**Problem**: Reviews list is empty but should have data
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint: `/api/vendor-reviews/vendor/:vendorId`
3. Check network tab for 404/500 errors
4. Ensure MongoDB connection is active

### Can't Submit Review
**Problem**: Submit button doesn't work
**Solutions**:
1. Check if user is logged in (JWT token valid)
2. Verify all required fields filled
3. Check for existing review (only one per user)
4. Look for validation errors in console

### Rating Not Updating
**Problem**: Vendor rating doesn't change after review
**Solutions**:
1. Check backend logs for `updateVendorRating` function
2. Verify review was saved successfully
3. Refresh vendor data in frontend
4. Check MongoDB for updated rating field

### Helpful Vote Not Working
**Problem**: Click doesn't register
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure user is logged in
2. Check network request completes
3. Verify state updates in React DevTools
4. Check if user already voted

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Testing
1. **Use Multiple Accounts**: Test with different users to see interactions
2. **Test Edge Cases**: 
   - Try submitting empty reviews
   - Try rating with 0 or 6 stars
   - Test with very long comments (>1000 chars)
3. **Test Performance**: Add many reviews and check pagination
4. **Mobile Testing**: Check responsive design on small screens

### For Development
1. **MongoDB Compass**: Use to inspect review documents directly
2. **React DevTools**: Check component state and props
3. **Redux DevTools**: Monitor Zustand store if needed
4. **Network Tab**: Monitor API calls and responses

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

The review system is fully responsive:
- Modal adapts to screen size
- Star rating remains interactive on touch
- Scrolling works within modal
- Buttons are touch-friendly (min 44px)

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Implemented
- JWT authentication required
- User can only edit/delete own reviews
- Vendor owner verification for responses
- XSS prevention in comments
- CORS configured properly

### To Monitor
- Rate limiting on review submissions
- Spam detection for duplicate content
- Profanity filtering (future enhancement)
- Review bombing prevention

## 📈 Analytics to Track

Monitor these metrics:
1. **Review Rate**: Reviews per vendor per month
2. **Helpful Votes**: Average helpful votes per review
3. **Edit Rate**: How often reviews are edited
4. **Rating Distribution**: Spread across 1-5 stars
5. **Response Rate**: Vendor responses per review
6. **User Engagement**: Active reviewers vs total users

## 🎯 Next Steps

After basic testing:
1. [ ] Test with real user data
2. [ ] Monitor performance with many reviews
3. [ ] Gather user feedback on UX
4. [ ] Add photo upload feature (future)
5. [ ] Implement review moderation (future)
6. [ ] Add email notifications (future)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the main documentation: `VENDOR_REVIEWS_SYSTEM.md`
2. Review backend logs for errors
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify all environment variables set
5. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
