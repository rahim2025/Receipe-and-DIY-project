## Validation & Security

## API Response Examples

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "reviews": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 15,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "pages": 2
  },
  "ratingDistribution": [
    { "_id": 5, "count": 8 },
    { "_id": 4, "count": 5 },
    { "_id": 3, "count": 2 }
  ]
}
```

### Create Review Response

### Caching Strategy (Future)

## Maintenance Notes

### Database Indexes
```javascript
{ vendor: 1, createdAt: -1 }
{ user: 1 }
{ rating: -1 }
{ vendor: 1, user: 1 } // Unique
```
